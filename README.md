Healthcare Data Analysis Using SQL

Overview
This project focuses on analyzing healthcare data to uncover patterns in patient admissions, medical test results, insurance utilization, and billing practices. The goal is to support data-driven decision-making in hospital management and patient care optimization.

Objectives
•	Identify common reasons for hospital admissions and medications
•	Analyze patient demographics and their relation to treatment outcomes
•	Examine billing amounts and detect outliers or potential inefficiencies
•	Evaluate insurance provider distribution across age groups
•	Monitor average length of stay by condition and admission type

Dataset
The data for this project is sourced from the Kaggle dataset.

Sample Business Problems
•	How many patients were admitted each year?         
•	How does billing amount vary by gender and medical condition?
•	Which doctor has handled the most cases?
•	Which medical condition has the longest average hospital stay?
•	Which combination of condition and medication is most common?
•	Do younger or older patients visit hospitals more often?
•	Find cases where patients with the same doctor had very different billing amounts.
•	Is there a difference in test results by age group?
•	Which hospital handles the most complex cases (most unique medical conditions)?
•	Which patients have been admitted more than once?
•	Outlier detection: patients with billing 3x the standard deviation above mean.

Key Insights
•	High-cost treatments often correlate with short stays — potential billing anomalies
•	Certain admission types are more frequently associated with abnormal test results
•	Older patients show higher reliance on specific insurance providers
•	Return visits are concentrated among patients with chronic conditions

Impact
These insights can help healthcare administrators reduce unnecessary costs, improve patient care, and make informed operational decisions.
